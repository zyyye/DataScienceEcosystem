# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

#  
#     
# ###### This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

# In[4]:


(3*4)+5


# 
# 
# ###### This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[5]:


min = 200
hours = min//60
minutes = min%60
time_string = "{}:{}".format(hours, minutes)
print(time_string)
